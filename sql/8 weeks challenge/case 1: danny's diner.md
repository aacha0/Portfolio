#### Q: If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
```sql
select s.customer_id, 
 sum(price*(case when product_name = 'sushi' then 2*10 else 10 end)) as total_points
 from sales s 
 join members m on s.customer_id =m.customer_id and s.order_date >= m.join_date

```sql
with cte as (
select s.customer_id, price, product_name, order_date,
case when order_date between order_date and date_add(order_date, interval 6 day) then 20
when order_date > date_add(order_date, interval 6 day) and product_name = 'sushi' then 20
else 10 end as points
from sales s 
join members m on s.customer_id =m.customer_id and s.order_date >= m.join_date
join menu me on me.product_id=s.product_id
where month(order_date) <=1) 

select customer_id, sum(price*points) as total_points

## 2. Bonus 
### Join All The Things
### The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.

### Recreate the following table output using the available data:
<img width="587" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 9 11 28 PM" src="https://github.com/aacha0/Portfolio/assets/148589444/d8016366-fbe7-46a2-ae1f-7750ff288bb9">

```sql
create view joined_table as (
select s.customer_id, s.order_date, me.product_name, me.price, 
case when m.customer_id is null then 'N' else 'Y' end as members
from sales s 
join menu me on s.product_id = me.product_id 
left join members m on m.customer_id = s.customer_id and m.join_date<=s.order_date
);
select * from joined_table
```
#### Output: 

<img width="339" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 9 17 16 PM" src="https://github.com/aacha0/Portfolio/assets/148589444/78c206d2-80a8-4fbd-9bbc-aeb83151f172">


#### Q: Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
```sql
select *, 
case when member = 'Y' then dense_rank()over(partition by member,customer_id order by order_date) else null end as ranking
from joined_table
order by 1
```
#### Output:
