-- I could simply order the table by the 'num_visits' in descending order and limit it to 3 rows. However, this approach will not accurately reflect the top 3 if there's a tie. Therefore, I created a CTE to rank 'page_name' based on the 'num_visits' first, and then retrieve the records that are ranked in the top 3

## 4. Campaigns Analysis

### Q: Generate a table consisting of the following columns: 

	user_id,
	visit_id,
	visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit,
	page_views: count of page views for each visit,
	cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit,
	purchase: flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
	campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
	impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
	click: count of ad clicks for each visit
	cart_products: a comma-separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart

	A: After further analysis of visits with at least one ad impression, it was found that visits where users clicked on ads had a purchase rate approximately 24% higher than visits where users did not click on ads.

#### Q: What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?

	A: Using the 'No Campaign' as a benchmark to compare the number of visits, the number of purchases, purchase rate, and average number of viewed pages, the campaign 'Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)' has the highest number of visits and purchases, making it appear to be the most popular campaign
